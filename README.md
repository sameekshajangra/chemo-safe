# CHEMO-SAFE
Hybrid Web + Desktop Safety Dashboard for School & College Chemistry Labs

As someone who grew up with a chemistry teacher as a mother and later trained in health informatics and wet-lab research, I wanted to build a tool that makes chemistry labs safer for students and teachers.

CHEMO-SAFE visualizes temperature, pressure and flowrate data from common equipment and computes two simple safety indices:
- **Burn-Risk Severity Index (BRSI)**
- **Reaction Hazard Potential (RHP)**

These help educators quickly identify risky equipment conditions.
